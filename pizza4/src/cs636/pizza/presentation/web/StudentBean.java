// This is the session bean (POJO) for the student-oriented web pages

// on another page first, the user is forwarded to that page.

// page visits.
// With page controllers in use, this bean has slimmed down to the
// point that it could be replaced by just an Integer roomNo attribute,
// but it can be thought of as a placeholder for a Student domain object
// with more properties.
