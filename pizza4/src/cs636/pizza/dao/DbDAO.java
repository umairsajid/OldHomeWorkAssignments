	// at once, each of which needs its own EM. We save the thread's 
	// EntityManager in a ThreadLocal, i.e., in thread-private memory,
	// a standard Java capability. Also see comment in commitTransaction.
	
	// Side Note: There are other ways to provide an EM for each
	// transaction. We could have startTransaction return an object to 
	// the service layer, where it could be kept in a local variable 
	// for the transaction lifetime, and add an argument to each DAO
	// method for returning the object to the DAO on each method call.
	// Or we could give up on DAO singletons, and create a DAO
	// object for each transaction. Or even give up on singletons
	// for both service objects and DAOs. This would be closest to
	// EJB architecture, but EJB provides object pools to make this
	// a higher performance option.
