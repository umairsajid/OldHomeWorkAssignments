SPECIAL MEETING - SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2010

</h3>



<h3></h3>
<p style="padding-left:15px;"></p>

<h3>From The Minister, Rev. Marjorie Matty</h3>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Forgiveness...<br /><br />

October was a fun-filled month with the parking lot fundraiser and the Halloween party!! A community such as ours is only as good as the members and friends who volunteer to make it all happen. Thank you Michael Mazurkiewicz for coordinating the successful three week long Halloween parking lot fundraiser and thank you to all of the many volunteers who spent time directing parkers and offering hospitality. Thank you to Marlyn Miller our Director of Religious Education and Sam Boylston our sexton who worked tirelessly to do the setup for the Halloween party and the many volunteers who cooked, cleaned and wrangled children. October is a wonderful example of how amazing and fun this community can be when we work together.<br /><br />

As we head into November we have many things on our calendar to think about beginning with the New Member classes which are scheduled for November 7th and 21st. If you are not a member of First Universalist as of yet please consider attending these sessions to learn more about Unitarian Universalism, First Universalist and how you can participate more fully in our community. Also, take a look at our online calendar on the First Universalist website to see the many upcoming events: 
<a href="http://salemuu.org/page2_calendar.html">http://www.salemuu.org</a><br /><br />


Our worship every month is "theme-based" which basically means that we focus on a topic throughout the month looking at it from various angles and in a more intensive manner. The theme for this month is forgiveness.  As we go into the holiday season I can only imagine that there may be some of us holding onto some old wound or resentment and what better time to let it go than right now before the holidays. I have to admit that sometimes this idea of letting go of old or not-so-old hurts and opening one's heart again to reconciliation and ultimately love can be challenging. As I think back about various experiences in my own life, I can almost bring up those old familiar feelings of frustration, resentment and anger. Sometimes it feels easier to hold onto these feelings than to actually let them go.<br /><br />

The person that comes to mind when I think about the work of forgiveness is the  Rev. Desmond Tutu who is an expert in forgiveness because of his work in South Africa. He helped a nation to uncover the truth and heal from the oppressive bonds of apartheid. Rev. Tutu has written extensively about forgiveness and he shares that, "To forgive is not just to be altruistic. It is the best form of self-interest. It is also a process that does not exclude hatred and anger. These emotions are all part of being human. You should never hate yourself for hating others who do terrible things: the depth of your love is shown by the extent of your anger. However, when I talk of forgiveness I mean the belief that you can come out the other side a better person. A better person than the one being consumed by anger and hatred. Remaining in that state locks you in a state of victimhood, making you almost dependent on the perpetrator. If you can find it in yourself to forgive then you are no longer chained to the perpetrator. You can move on, and you can even help the perpetrator to become a better person too."<br /><br />

With this said it takes so much courage and commitment to face into the struggles and challenges that are caused by the wounds one has sustained, whether they are emotional, physical or psychic. Fear, anxiety and anger can paralyze us and stop us from taking action and ultimately to let go and move on. This is a question that we will be thinking about over the next month, "Is it really possible to forgive?" As with all things I believe that forgiveness is a choice that one must be ready and willing to make in order to give oneself over to it.
There is an interesting saying by an unknown author that shares, "Holding resentment is like eating poison and waiting for the other person to keel over." The only one that we are hurting with that bitter poison is ourselves. I look forward to taking the next month to ponder and unpack what forgiveness is and how it can set us free.<br /><br />


In Faithful Service, <br />

Rev. Marjorie Matty
</p>

<h3>RELIGIOUS EDUCATION NEWS</h3>
 
<p style="padding-left:15px;">The religious education year is off to a wonderful start! It’s been such a pleasure to see all of our children again, plus a number of new faces. We have three classrooms and a youth group with approximately forty children registered. This year our kids are concentrating on Unitarian Universalist identity and values. Besides our regular classroom activities, the kids participated in Climate Work Day on the Salem Common on October 10th, with the kids from First Church Unitarian, we held a delightful parent and family night on October 1st, and participated in the Second Annual Halloween Party on October 27th. <br /><br />

November and December will likewise be full of exciting events in our program, including our first Children’s Chapel on November 7th, an “exchange” of our third to fifth graders with First Church on November 14th, and our usual Intergenerational Cornbread Communion Service on November 21st. In December, we will use our holiday term to plan, build, and rehearse for our Christmas Eve service. We will celebrate Hanukkah on Friday, December 3rd with food, dancing, and games – please come if you can! We will also offer a “Parent’s Night Off” in early December, where kids can come and have fun while parents have an evening to themselves. <br /><br />

In the area of social justice, our kids will be working on a fundraiser for our sponsored Unitarian Universalist student in the Philippines, and the K-2 class will be designing and implementing a fundraiser for Heifer International. We’re looking forward to learning and growing into our Unitarian Universalist faith in the months ahead.<br /><br />
 
Wishing for you all the blessings of the season.<br />
 
Marlyn Miller<br />
Director of Religious Education</p>


<h3>NOTES FROM THE BOARD</h3>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">The Board of Trustees devoted much of our October meeting to the structure and staffing of church committees.<br /><br />

There are more than fourteen committees in our church community which deal with issues from flowers to permanent funds. Even though our membership is healthy and growing, it does not seem that we have a big enough church to fully staff these committees. In addition, some functions are duplicated or overlapped between committees. In some cases, the work is made unnecessarily hard because committees are unclear of their exact responsibilities and how to accomplish them.
It is important to note that there are several committees that have already accomplished much this year. The Building/House Committee has completed several projects. Every Sunday we hear the work of the Music Committee. RE is going strong under the guidance of the RE Committee. Deacons are busy with their most important work. The Communication Committee has a new website up and running. Hospitality Committee provides a great Happy Hour, a.k.a. coffee hour.  Permanent Funds Committee is hard at work watching our investment.  Every week we have a noteworthy saying on the signboard and we are greeted by friendly ushers. I am sure that I missed some committee work. Please know that the Board and the Congregation appreciates all the hard work that makes up our blessed society.<br /><br />

The Board is taking a close look to determine if some committees may be consolidated and if a reallocation of responsibilities might streamline the committee structure and reduce the number of volunteers needed to staff the committee. We would like to provide a clear statement of responsibilities and constructive input as to how best to achieve these. It will be easier for a member to follow their interests and passions when volunteering for committee work when it is clear to all what the responsibilities of the individual committee are. All will benefit if we can make efficient, productive and rewarding use of the time that we volunteer as committee members.
Beth Toolan, a long time member of the church, Head Deacon, and a professional who works in the field of management of volunteer based organizations met with the Board to discuss how best to approach these issues. The beginnings of many good ideas came out of our discussion. You will be hearing some of them soon.<br /><br />

The Board is committed to moving carefully on these issues with the full input of the congregation.  Please expect to hear about opportunities to share your experiences and opinions with the Board.<br /><br />

Please do not hesitate to contact me with your concerns and suggestions. Email is best, but a phone call is fine, too. <br /><br />
 
Peace, Denise<br />

<h3>PATH TO MEMBERSHIP CLASSES</h3>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">This fall we will hold classes for those interested in joining First Universalist Church.  Classes will be held after church on November 7th & 21st at 12:30-3 PM in the library.<br /><br />
Rev. Matty will cover Unitarian Universalist history and polity, our church’s history and governance, as well as expectations of members.  These classes are a prerequisite to membership.  At the completion of the classes, participants may sign the membership book if they choose.  All are welcome to attend the classes.<br /><br />
If you are interested in attending, please sign up in the Anna Hill Room.  Please note if you will need child care.</p>


<h3>FROM THE DEACON’S DESK</h3>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">The Deacons: Who We Are and What We Do<br /><br />


The deacons are committed to the care and nurturing of the church community and working with the minister to ensure that the worship experience is meaningful and spiritually uplifting. Together we coordinate lay-led services, securing guest ministers, community leaders, and congregation members who share their thoughts on a variety of relevant topics on Sundays when the minister is not present. In addition, the Deacons assist the minister with worship services, serve communion on communion Sundays, and manage the details of the worship service, from lighting candles and arranging flowers to recording joys and concerns, throughout the year and for holiday services.
<br /><br />
The Deacons also coordinate Care Corps, the lay-led ministry of the congregation. We provide support, through phone calls and visits, meals or rides to our church friends and members who are ill, injured, or have suffered a loss. We are here to provide care and company to those in need.
<br /><br />
This years Deacons are Liz Duff, Joyce Prior, Elizabeth Black, Brenda Briana, and Beth Toolan. Please contact any of us if you or someone you know are in need of a little extra care.
<br /><br />
Gift Drive for Local Charities:

<br />
The holiday season has arrived!  Once again the Deacons are coordinating a Christmas Charity gift giving to several local charities.  Beginning November 14th gift tags will be displayed in the sanctuary.  Each will have a name of a charity, and an indication of whom the gift is for.  Look for suggestions for gift items in the rear of the sanctuary and in the Anna Hill room, where we have coffee hour.  We invite you to choose a gift tag (or two!) and to bring the gift in to the church on or before December 5th.  These will then be delivered to the charities. Charities include: The Strongest Link (for people and families who are living with and affected by AIDS/HIV), HAWC (Healing Abuse, Working for Change, formerly Help for Abused Women and Children), Lifebridge (caring for homeless and hungry people, formerly known as the Salem Mission), the Clara Barton Diabetes Camp, and the Northeast Animal Shelter.  Gifts should be unwrapped.<br /><br />
 
If you are able to help with delivering the gifts please contact Beth Toolan.<br /><br />
 
Readings for the New Year
<br /><br />
Our lay-led service “Readings for the New Year”: will occur on December 26th  this year.    Please bring a reading to share.  This is a great opportunity to share readings that inspire you with your church community.</p>

<br /><br />

<h3 style="padding-left:15px;">First Universalist Society of Salem<br />
Permanent Funds Investment Policy</h3>
   
   <p style="padding-left:30px;">
General Statement<br />
The purpose of this Investment Policy is to guide the Trustees of Permanent Funds (hereafter referred to as the Trustees) and professional investment managers when making investment decisions.  The guidelines in this policy have been approved by the members of the Society and are to be followed when investing and managing the Permanent Funds of the Society. This policy shall be reviewed periodically by the Trustees and modified as necessary.<br /><br />

Responsibility for Investments<br />
The Trustees  shall have ultimate responsibility for investing the assets belonging to the First Universalist Society Permanent Funds.<br /><br />
	      
Trustees Functions and Responsibilities<br />
The Trustees shall engage one or more investment managers in order to meet the investment objectives of the Fund, consistent with the Trustees’ obligation to the Society to invest the Funds in a prudent manner.  The investment managers may be compensated for their services by commissions for transactions, a fee based on the assets of the Fund or any combination of both as is considered to be reasonable by the Trustees.  <br /><br />

The Trustees shall provide oversight of the investment managers. The investment managers may be terminated by action of the Trustees at their sole discretion.<br /><br />

The Custodians for the assets of the Funds shall be separate legal entities from the investment managers. All statements and transaction confirmations shall be received from the Custodians.
The Trustees of Permanent Funds will meet at least every three months. Periodic reports on the current earnings and withdrawals of the fund will be provided to the congregation via the newsletter and other communications.  A full report with details on earnings, growth and overall condition of the Funds will be presented to the congregation at the Annual Meeting. The Trustees will provide monthly balance reports of the Funds to the Board of Trustees.  The Trustees will be advised by the investment managers of any substantial investment changes or other conditions that warrant immediate attention.  These changes will be communicated to the Board.<br /><br />

The Trustees will communicate to the Board and congregation the importance of preserving and growing the purchasing power of the principal of the fund. This will allow us to provide income to the Society that may increase with inflation.<br /><br />

The Trustees of the Permanent Funds shall be elected according to the By-Laws.   <br /><br />

Investment Objective<br />
The investment objective of the First Universalist Society Permanent Funds is to help provide income to support church operations. The Permanent Funds are to be invested in such a manner as to provide income and growth consistent with the Society’s responsibility to the community and society overall.<br /><br />

Investment Guidelines<br />
The Permanent Funds shall be measured on a five year rolling basis by comparison with a 50%/50% blend of the Standard and Poor’s 500 total return index and the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond index or their equivalent successor indices.  Such performance measures shall include all income paid out to the individual funds.<br /><br />

Annual distribution amounts from the individual funds shall be based on the budget prepared by the Board of the Society and approved by the congregation.<br /><br />

The Permanent Funds may be invested in publicly traded securities (including funds as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940) consistent with the social and ethical responsibility of the Society.  <br /><br />

Fixed income investments shall be limited to securities rated as investment grade at the time of purchase.<br /><br />

The Funds shall not own securities for which there is no public marketplace, such as but not limited to private placements, letter stock, etc.  The Funds shall not own securities which may constitute a conflict of interest with any of the Trustees or the investment managers hired to manage the Funds.<br /><br />

Social Responsibility Guidelines for Investments.<br />
In keeping with the values of Unitarian Universalism, the Funds shall not be invested in:</p>

<p style="padding-left:60px;">
<ul>
    <li>Companies producing products, offering services or operating in a manner which may be unsafe to the consumer or pose a threat to the environment.  </li>
    <li>Companies predominately involved in the production of war materiel.</li>
    <li>Businesses that discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, creed, disability, affectional or sexual orientation, age, national origin or religion, or exploit the poor or deprived.</li>
    <li>Businesses that fail to provide a safe and healthy work environment and fair and equal employment opportunities for all persons in their labor force.</li>
</ul> </p>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">
When possible, the Trustees will monitor investment recommendations using tools such as www.corporatecritic.org and other resources that help monitor social responsibility performance.  We will rely on our advisors to help steer us away from investments not in keeping with our values.<br /><br />

Asset Allocation Parameters<br />
The following broad asset allocation parameters shall be used in order to meet the long- term investment goals of the Fund:<br /><br />

Name: Minimum/Target/Maximum<br />
Equity:	25% / 	50% / 	60%<br />
Fixed Income:	35%  /	45%	/ 75%<br />
Cash:5%	/ 5%	/ 40%<br /><br />

Diversification in Equities<br />
The Fund shall be diversified among individual sectors such that at least 6 of the 11 sectors of the Standard and Poor’s 500 shall be represented among equity holdings.  No single security shall represent more than 10% of the overall holdings, and no sector shall represent more than 25% of the overall holdings.<br /><br />

Monitoring Requirements<br />
The Trustees shall be responsible for monitoring the performance of the investment managers and shall receive reports at least quarterly.  Trustees shall receive monthly reports on performance from the investment managers and will be notified promptly in the event of market conditions warranting immediate attention. Investment managers will provide quarterly reports to the Trustees preferably in person.<br /><br />
The Trustees shall review any changes in circumstances with the investment managers, such as lagging performance, personnel changes, or change in philosophy and act accordingly as required by the circumstances, including termination of the relationship.

<h3>COMMUNITY SERVICE OPPORTUNITY: LIFEBRIDGE</h3>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Indeed, we are living in challenging economic times. Increasingly common are persons made homeless by factors that make the nightly news, such as foreclosure, poverty, rising unemployment, and declines in public assistance. Alas, these problems are not absent in our own backyard.<br /><br />
Located at 56 Margin Street and formerly known as the Salem Mission, Lifebridge is a non-profit organization serving people in our community with the provision of shelter, housing, community meals, and essential services.  They are a team of skilled and knowledgeable team of case managers, health care providers, and employment specialists serving over 1,000 clients annually, supported in part by over 400 volunteers each year who contribute time in the kitchen, food pantry, and thrift store.<br /><br />
There are two ways you can help!  A sign up sheet is posted in the Anna Hill Room, or you may contact Carole McCauley at (978) 882-2749.<br /><br />
1. Sign up as-you-go for “Second Wednesdays” and serve just once or twice a year.<br /><br />
2. Sign up to be a part of the regular “Fourth Wednesday” group, which serves monthly.<br /><br />

The food and menu are provided by Lifebridge, as well as a food prep coordinator. All you have to do is show up for dinner prep between 4:30-5 PM and work through the meal service, which ends at 7 PM. Lifebridge residents do the cleanup.<br /><br />

Here’s what some of our members are saying about why they participate at Lifebridge…<br /><br />

<i>"I consider the people who spend time at the Mission as my neighbors."<br /><br />
"Simply put, I have been homeless and hungry, I know what it feels like"<br /><br />
 "My reason for volunteering at the Salem Mission is purely selfish...it makes me feel good about myself."<br />
 "I find it very spiritually rewarding to participate in [our] meal efforts at the Salem Mission."</i><br /><br />

A huge pat on the back to Lifebridge volunteers for August, September, and October: Nancy Bacigalupo, Donna Blume, Coty DuPuis, Joyce Prior, Kathleen Riley, Michelle Rust, Sarah and Bill Smith, and Chris Weis!  We could not do it without you dedicated people!<br /><br />

 We hope you all have had a chance to explore the site.   We are still tweaking it and adding content so feel free to send us your comments and suggestions.<br /><br />
 Phase Two is scheduled for next Spring.   In addition to a member login section we'll be expanding current content and, YES, we need more pictures.    Please take your camera to church and take some shots that capture First Universalist in Action (that means people and lots of activity) or some shots that would be appropriate for our banners.   We'll be running another contest, this time with the membership choosing the winners.

<h3>SMALL GROUP MINISTRY PROGRAM</h3>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">Look for sign-up sheets at the back of the sanctuary and/or the hutch in the Anna Hill room.<br /><br />
These groups will meet from 7—9 PM in the Anna Hill room.  Wednesday group will meet the first Wednesday of every month starting November 3rd.  Monday group will start meeting on November 8th.

<h3>USHERING IS AS EASY AS 1, 2, 3 . . . A, B, C</h3>

<p style="padding-left:30px;">

<ul>
    <li>1) Arrive around 10:15 AM to get ready for handing out the Order of Service.</li>
    <li>2) Take a head count of adults, children, and young children in the Nursery and record them in the notebook on the table at the back of the sanctuary.</li>
    <li>3) Take the offering.</li>
</ul> </p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">
That’s it!<br /><br />

Well, there are some other important things to know, but if you can help with the basics that would be great.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">
<ul>
    <li>A) The device for the hearing impaired is in the left-hand drawer of the table located at the back of the sanctuary. Simple instructions included.</li>
    <li>B) There’s a Braille hymnal and a large print hymnal located at the back of the sanctuary over by the recording machine.</li>
    <li>C) Last year the Deacons asked me if the ushers could take over the job of recording each service. Well, even with instructions I still lean on Helen Jacoby or Mark Stevens, who graciously take care of this. But, we’re always looking for more congregants to learn the steps. Let me know if you’d like to learn how to work the recording machine.</li>
    <li>D) After the service, if you have time, it’s always appreciated if you (and ask a friend!) could tidy up the pews by picking up the Order of Services (to recycle), and stack the hymnals on the seat of the pews, with a Welcome Pamphlet (yellow) on top. NOTE: Even though it goes against our engrained inclination to put the hymnals back into the wooden racks, many have broken over the years. So, we’d prefer the hymnals be stacked on the seat of the pews. </li>
    <li>Thanks. </li>
</ul>  </p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">
Most Sundays we’ll only need one usher. We have Ned Wickberg, our Lead Usher, to thank for helping the church by volunteering his time in this capacity. (Great job, Ned!!) The Sundays he can’t make it, I’ll need two ushers. <br /><br />
To sign up, please consult the Usher sign-up sheet, located on the bulletin board in the Anna Hill Room. Call or send me an email letting me know that you’ve just signed up for a particular Sunday.
<br /><br />
Thanks! <br />
See you in church,<br />
