<h3>Our Faith in Action</h3>

<p>Persons from the Unitarian Universalist community have been involved in social justice work for centuries.  Indeed, being active members in a community is something that draws many UUs to the faith.  That "community" is not confined to the walls of a congregation's sanctuary is another essential part of our shared ideology.  Directly experiencing different facets of community life is a major source of strength and inspiration for people on a spiritual journey.</p>

<p>The First Universalist Society of Salem (FUSS) has a long tradition of community-oriented action and activism. Two of the most active programs that FUSS members and friends take part in are the Salem Pantry and Lifebridge. Additionally, we have taken part in events such as the Boston Pride Parade and Salem's own Walk for HAWC.  In 2010, we joined forces with the Essex Street UU congregation to raise the third-largest contribution for the 2010 HAWC walk in the effort to end domestic violence!</p>

<p>For more information about some of our core programs, visit the links on the right.</p>

<!-- <p>We are pleased to know of events in our community that supports our beliefs:</p>-->

<h3>Lifebridge</h3>

<p>Indeed, we are living in challenging economic times. Increasingly common are persons made homeless by factors that make the nightly news, such as foreclosure, poverty, rising unemployment, and declines in public assistance. Homelessness is also a serious problem experienced by the mentally ill, addicts, and victims of domestic violence. Alas, these problems are not absent in our own backyards.</p>


<p>What is Lifebridge?</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">Formerly known as the Salem Mission, Lifebridge is a non-profit organization loated at 56 Margin Street in Salem serving people in our community with the provision of shelter, housing, community meals, and essential services. A team of skilled and knowledgeable team of case managers, health care providers, and employment specialists serving over 1,000 clients annually, supported in part by over 400 volunteers each year who contribute time in the kitchen, food pantry, and thrift store.</p>


<p>What do FUSS volunteers do at Lifebridge?</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">Volunteers from our church help prepare and serve dinner for the residents of Salem Mission on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month. The food and menu are provided by Lifebridge, as well as a food prep coordinator. All you have to do is show up for dinner prep between 4:30-5:30pm, and then stay through dinner serving from 6:30-7:00pm. Lifebridge residents do the cleanup.</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">Our church serves the Lifebridge community twice per month. On the second Wednesday of each month, we team with other UU churches in the area, and on the fourth Wednesday of the month, we provide an entire team's worth of volunteers. There is always room to expand our service with additional volunteer interest!</p>


<p>Why do FUSS members and friends volunteer?</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">"I consider the people who spend time at the Mission as my neighbors, since I live right around the corner. I like spending time with my neighbors and considering them as people who live in my neighborhood, not as homeless people."  - Sarah
</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">"At the beginning of 2008 I decided I needed to give back to my community. That week I received two emails, one asking if I could donate blood and one asking if I could volunteer at The Salem Mission. I am still active in both pursuits today. Simply put, I have been homeless and hungry, I know what it feels like, and it is a privilege to be able to support the process that supported me."  - Nancy</p>
 
<p style="padding-left:15px;">"My reason for volunteering at the Salem Mission is purely selfish,...it makes me feel good about myself. Also, the saying "Do unto others"...is a sensible way of living one's life."  - Janet</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">"For me, feeding the hungry is one of life's great pleasures. I find it very spiritually rewarding to participate in [our] meal efforts at the Salem Mission."  - Thomas</p>


<p>How do I get involved?</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;">You don't have to be a member of FUSS to get involved in our team! For more information please contact Carole at (978) 882-2749 or email the church administrator at firstuniversalsalem @ verizon.net.</p>

<h3>Water Canteen Borrow Program</h3>



<p>The First Universalist Society of Salem is proud  to partner with <a href="http://www.andreafoxcommunications.com/" target="_blank">Andrea Fox Communications</a> in the Citizens for Salem/Beverly Water Resources program.  </p>

<p>Borrowing of the canteens by public event planners in Salem and Beverly will make a measurable difference in the amount of plastic bottle waste produced and greatly support “Take Back the Tap” ideology. The Water Canteen Borrow Program, with First Universalist Society of Salem’s support, is a unique natural resource preservation effort and shows a great deal of environmental leadership not only in our region, but in Massachusetts and New England.</p>

<p>Use of the canteens at three recent Salem events displaced the equivalent of at least 350 eight oz. single use, PET plastic water bottles--greatly reducing the environmental footprint of these small events and supporting Salem/Beverly’s water resources. </p>

<p>As hosts of  this program we are pleased to provide the water for the events and storage for the canteens</p>

<p>For more information on how to borrow the canteens go to 
<a href="http://www.andreafoxcommunications.com/adhoc.html" target="_blank">Citizens for Salem/Beverly Water Resources program</a> .</p>

<h3>Care Corps</h3>

<p>Deacons</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">The deacons are involved with the care of the church community and worship details. Together they manage lay led services, serve communion on communion Sundays, and handle the particles of worship throughout the year and for holiday services. Each deacon participates in thoughout Sunday worship.<br /><br />

Every month a deacon participates in the managing of Care Core and any concerns involved with it. 
</p>

<p>Why Was Care Core Created?</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Care Core was started by the Deacons of this church a few years ago to assist our Minister in caring for our members. With this program, we are working to strengthen our ability as a congregation to minister to each other and support one another. In a church our size, it is impossible for the minister to provide continuing and personal care for each congregant in need. Furthermore, the ministry of the church is not reserved to the minister but is the responsibility of the entire church. While the minister is usually available in a crisis, other church members serve well in non-crisis situations.<br /><br />

As a result, we have created a Care Core to help meet needs when they come up and to lend a supportive hand. Care Core is a system connecting people in our caring church community to those in need. We are a church abundant in talented, caring people who enjoy helping each other out.</p>


<p>How Can This Program Be Important to a Church Member?</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Lending a hand and reaching out is a mutual experience. When one gives, one receives--when one receives, one gives. Care Core volunteers are asked to commit a small amount of their time, anywhere from one hour a week or one hour a month to one hour a year. This way, many people can be helped and our resources won’t be exhausted. This program is really the best kind of donation; you give, and through that act alone, you receive. Everyone needs help at some point in their life. Help us to help you.<br /><br />

This program has been operating for a few years now. Our church has seen firsthand the benefits. The recipients have been grateful and have felt loved and cared for; the givers have felt the warm feeling we get when we go out of our way to do something for someone else.</p>


<p>How Does Care Core Work?</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Basically, it works like this... One of us has gotten ill and is hospitalized ; perhaps we are alone and need help once we return home. The Deacons then go to the Care Core Directory and find out who has volunteered for "Visiting Someone in the Hospital;" we then call upon that volunteer and ask them to go the hospital for a brief visit. The Deacons may call upon a volunteer to "Send Cards or Flowers." When the person who is ill returns home, a "Meal Prepared" for them and/or their family may be needed or perhaps some "Shopping and Errands" . <br /><br />

Then, a few days later, they may love to have a "Friendly Phone Call" following up to see how they’re recuperating<br /><br />

As you can see, caring for each other can be a big job. But we have the resources needed to do all that and more. The services above would not be accomplished by just one or two Care Core volunteers, but would be carried out by 5 or 6 of our church members who are very happy and willing to participate. Care Core is not designed to take care of every need we may have, but to be a support.</p>

<p>How Can I Get More Information?</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Some people would like to find out more about this program. Any of the Deacons (listed in the sidebar above) would love to talk to you, to answer your questions and to hear your ideas. We are all familiar with the program and have seen how important it is to our church.</p>

<p>Who Can Be A Care Core Volunteer?</p>
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Anyone who wishes to help out and can afford to donate some of their time--as little or as much as you choose. They really make a difference to many of us who found ourselves in need. </p>

<h3>Member's Passions</h3>
 
<p style="padding-left:15px;"> One of the reasons that many individuals are drawn to Unitarian Universalism is a strong belief in social justice and action at both the community and global level.  While we regularly take collective interest and action as a congregation, it is natural that the fiber of the congregation is made up of threads from persons who are also involved in their own individual pursuits.  A number of First Universalist members are foster and/or adoptive parents.  Some have served in the Peace Corps or been involved with other volunteer service organizations nationally and overseas.  Many are involved with social justice and community development in their professional lives, as advocates, organizers, healers, teachers, to name a few.  While our collective actions speak volumes about our identity as a church, the individual actions that we take are no less definitive of that common identity.</p>

 
<p>
Here's what one member of the First Universalist community has to say about her own experience:</p>
 

<p style="padding-left:15px;"><i>"My experience working with HAWC has led me to do shelter work, to fundraise, to help obtain restraining orders to protect abuse sufferers, and to work the emergency hotline. Social justice work is one way I and other people at church reach out and give back to the community. For me, this work is an expression of the belief of the inherent worth and dignity of every individual, one of our UU principles. I first got involved because I felt that there needed to be a place where an abused person could reach out for information and some sense of safety and/or understanding. [I wanted] to be able to express and provide possible options to meet their individual needs, as sometimes one doesn’t feel that there is any way out of a given situation without fresh eyes to look at [it].  As word of mouth has gotten out, when similar situations have occurred in other areas of my life, I have been called upon to help.  It reminds me of dropping a pebble in a pool and then watching how far the  ripples spread.  If each of us does just one thing to help another, how far will we all go toward a belief in the worth of everyone and a better world?"

<p>
Here's what another member of the First Universalist community has to say about his own experience:</p>

<p style="padding-left:15px;"><i>When my cousin died of AIDS  (back in the pre-Harvey Milk days) and the church of his original upbringing refused to hold his service due to his “unconventional sexual lifestyle”, there was never even a moment's hesitation that a service commemorating his passing could be held at the First Universalist Society of Salem <br /><br />

And held it was, with the eternal gratitude of a grateful grieving  family. <br /><br />  

There was never even the slightest moment of  hesitation about the service from minister or congregation, who all came together underneath a steeple where,  for more than 200 years, all are welcome: bible-toting Deists, Agnostics, Wiccans, lapsed Catholics, Buddhists, Muslims,  Humanists or certified Heathens, all continue to be welcome, in the spirit of love and truth, irregardless.</i>
