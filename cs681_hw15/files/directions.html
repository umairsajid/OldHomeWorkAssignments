<h3>Parking</h3>

<p>The church has a small parking lot accessible from Bridge Street, if you are able bodied please consider parking in the Church Street parking lot (off of Washington Street) or the T-Station parking lot (off of Bridge Street). This will allow the parking lot behind the church to be used by our elders and those who are not currently able bodied. If you are in need of closer parking there is an accessible parking spot right outside of the Ash Street door, which is our accessible entrance. You can also find additional parking, for a small fee, at the Museum Place Mall (off of St Peter's Street), and the Salem Garage (off of New Liberty Street) - all of which are a short walk to the church.</p>

<p>The Church and Church Office entrances are located in the courtyard, which is on the opposite side of the building from the Church parking lot. </p>
